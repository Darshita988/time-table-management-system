# Schedule Template

A simple template that lets you display events on a timeline, as well as organize them in groups (week days, conference rooms etcâ€¦).

## How to build your Timetable?

- Clone the repo.

- Open index.html and customize as per your schedule and save it.

* Delete the .git file from root folder. If you cannot see it, enable the option see hidden file in desktop.

* After doing it, upload the root folder in github and enable Github Pages. For more reference on uploading files on Github and hosting your own timetable, check out my blog.
